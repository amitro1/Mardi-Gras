        <h1> About The Mardi Gras</h1>
        <div class="text mt-2">
            <p>Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she joined the
                board of the
                Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association in 2004.[4] After the 2005
                levee failures in
                Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and
                remained mostly
                deserted for months afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon panel
                convened by
                then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New Orleans
                neighborhoods to be
                converted into greenspace.[5][6] In her role as president of the association, Cantrell worked with
                residents and local
                religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist returning
                Broadmoor
                residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood.[7]

                Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and fellow
                residents formed
                the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of the Andrew H. Wilson school.[8]
                She served as a
                founding board member of the Broadmoor Development Corporation, a community development corporation that
                provided case
                management and other social services for returning residents.[9] She was involved with residents'
                efforts to reopen
                Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant from the Carnegie Endowment.[10] She
                created a
                partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and Church of the Annunciation, which provided
                the
                neighborhood association with office space and hosted volunteer groups.[11] She also formed a
                partnership between the
                Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish, Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open the
                Broadmoor Art and
                Wellness Center.[12]

            <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in southern Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                Celebrations are
                concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the
                start of lent in
                the Western Christian tradition). Mardi Gras is French for Fat Tuesday, but the season actually begins
                on King’s Day
                (12th Night), January 6th, and extends until midnight before Ash Wednesday. Club, or Krewe, balls start
                soon after,
                though most are extremely private, with their Kings and Queens coming from wealthy old families and
                their courts
                consisting of the season’s debutantes. Most of the high society Krewes do not stage parades. As Fat
                Tuesday gets nearer,
                the parades start in earnest. Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days
                have several
                large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras
                season. In the
                final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and
                balls (some of
                them masquerade balls).

                The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
                schedule and route
                each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
                Knights of Momus and
                the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events
                (often featuring
                celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
                Pleasure Club—a
                predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most
                common throws are
                strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", and small inexpensive
                toys. Major krewes
                follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

                While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate
                in the Uptown and
                Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of
                the French
                Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and 'tit Rex - also take place downtown in
                the Faubourg
                Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally
                concludes with the
                "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.[1]</p>
